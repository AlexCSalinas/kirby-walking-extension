## Customization

Want to tweak how Kirby behaves? Open `content.js` and adjust these values:
```javascript
const speed = 1.5;           // How fast Kirby moves (higher = faster)
const bottomOffset = 50;     // Distance from bottom of screen
const minWaitTime = 3000;    // Minimum wait time in milliseconds (3 seconds)
const maxWaitTime = 10000;   // Maximum wait time in milliseconds (10 seconds)
const pixelsPerFrame = 14;   // Animation speed (lower = faster walking animation)
After making changes, go to chrome://extensions/ and click the refresh icon on the extension, then reload any webpage to see your changes.
